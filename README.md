##### Future 3D print monitoring program. Note that this desctiption is definitly not final :) Just to get the idea
---
## Idea 😎
A tool to monitor the current printed layer on a 3D printer, track the percentage progress, and more! 🖨️✨
My original plan was to run the program on arduino but then i came to a conclusion that it isnt possible any more. But it brings more future functions.
I will also desing an case for the raspberry pi and display for this.

In the future there will be also an option to show temperagures and speeds like this ⬇️

Please again this is just Photoshoped in 2 minutes. It will be way better 💦

## Features 🌟
- Visualization of the current layer being printed 🖼️
- Real-time percentage progress tracking 📈
- Temperagures and speed stats ⏫

## How it works 🤔
The program comunicates with your printer via the Moonraker API. And gets all the information it needs.
You just need to know the printer IP and Port!

## Examples
Example output of print animation 😎

For the fact it was made only from gcode without simulation it is very pretty.
